# What happened to my GitHub account?

<details>
<summary>2015 GH story</summary>

I've gone through different medical situations and ended up deleting several accounts in the internet, including GitHub ones. The only internet account I've not deleted/lost is my [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/hydroper), which is from the 2014 year. (In a certain way, I still have my first Steam account basically loggable as well, but it's a bit inaccessible.)

[Here's one example question I asked in StackOverflow in 2015.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31146403/how-to-make-url-clear) (As you can see, my written English was a little poor as I'm not a native speaker.)

Why did I delete them? I was feeling faulty of content I used to consume; the accounts were an island of different contents, and after a doctor prescribed me a medication I started to have convulsions, feeling insecure.

My first GH account was around 2015 december (the era in which I used to call myself "Hand on Cloud" and rarely Hydroper/Klaider Klai). I've not anything anymore to show, except 2019 things like the [alien.as](https://github.com/alien-as) organisation.

This GH account contains newer works; the previous GH account (still not the very old one) is just [hydroper](https://github.com/hydroper), but I lost its 2FA access.

I started learning dev stuff in the 2014's even, or pratically 2015's beginning.

# Current project

I've up to sometime kept infinitely in the cycle of making a scripting language be reality, and eventually its bigger framework. However that currently proves hard, so I decided to mask an existing structurally-typed scripting language as another language leveraging their compiler infrastructure and relying on JIT engines like V8 and as a fallback, WebView.

I might announce the project in the future. It is basically an alternative to Adobe Flex.
