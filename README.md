# Metro design

I've a Metro components library for React.js. There is an old version and a new one without a demo for now.

# ShockScript

[*ShockScript*](https://github.com/shockscript) is a language I've been developing since 2017 (I've lost/deleted its big number of repositories, but that doesn't matter). I'm currently undecided as to what path I'll take.

# Whack

[*Whack engine*](https://github.com/whackengine) would be a platform for the development of rich internet applications. Its development has not been started.

I considered using pure Rust instead of ShockScript for saving time, however procedural macros difficultly are flexible for XML-like expressions targetting a reactive UI system.
