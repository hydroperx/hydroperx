# Metro design

I've a Metro components library for React.js, but it's not frequently maintained, anymore. I could have done specific things differently, but that's it.

# JITScript

[*JITScript (abbrev. JS)*](https://github.com/jitscriptx) is a language I've been developing since 2017 (I've lost/deleted its big number of repositories, but that doesn't matter). I'm currently undecided as to what path I'll take.

# Whack

[*Whack for JITScript*](https://github.com/whackone) would be a platform for the development of rich internet applications. Its development has not been started.

I considered using pure Rust instead of JITScript for saving time, however procedural macros difficultly are flexible for XML-like expressions targetting a reactive UI system.
