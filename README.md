# Metro design

I've a Metro components library for React.js, but it's not frequently maintained, anymore. I could have done specific things differently, but that's it.

# ShockScript

ShockScript is a language I've been developing since 2017 (I've lost/deleted its big number of repositories, but that doesn't matter). I'm currently undecided as to what path I'll take.
