# What happened to my GitHub account?

<details>
<summary>2015 GH story</summary>

I've gone through different medical situations and ended up deleting several accounts in the internet, including GitHub ones. The only internet account I've not deleted/lost is my [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/hydroper), which is from the 2014 year. (In a certain way, I still have my first Steam account basically loggable as well, but it's a bit inaccessible.)

Why did I delete them? I was feeling faulty of content I used to consume, and the accounts were an island of different contents, and after a doctor passed me a medication I start to have convulsions feeling insecure.

My first GH account was around 2015 december (the era in which I used to call myself "Hand on Cloud" and rarely Hydroper/Klaider Klai). I've not anything anymore to show, except 2019 things like the [alien.as](https://github.com/alien-as) organisation.

This GH account contains newer works; the previous GH account (still not the very old one) is just [hydroper](https://github.com/hydroper), but I lost its 2FA access.

I started learning dev stuff in the 2014's even, or pratically 2015's beginning.

# Metro design

I've a Metro components library for React.js. There is an old version and a new one without a demo for now.

# ShockScript

[*ShockScript*](https://github.com/shockscript) is a language I've been developing since 2017 (I've lost/deleted its big number of repositories, but that doesn't matter). I'm currently undecided as to what path I'll take.

# Whack

[*Whack engine*](https://github.com/whackengine) would be a platform for the development of rich internet applications. Its development has not been started.

I considered using pure Rust instead of ShockScript for saving time, however procedural macros difficultly are flexible for XML-like expressions targetting a reactive UI system.
